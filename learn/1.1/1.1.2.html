                    <p><b>Graphics Processing Units</b> (<b>GPUs</b>) are specialised electronic circuits, which are very efficient in manipulating computer graphics and image-processing. GPUs:</p>

                    <p>These features mean that it is more efficient at displaying graphics than a CPU, which is a general purpose processor. The GPU is a form of co-processor, and may be used by the CPU to compute sections of a program, while the rest of the sequential code (which the GPU can't run) is run by the CPU. resulting in improved performance for the user.</p>
                    <p>Due to their specialist capabilities, GPUs also have many uses outside of graphics processing, such as modelling physical systems, audio processing, cracking passwords and machine learning among many others.</p>

                    A <b>parallel system</b> is a system where multiple independent processors are used simultaneously to work on the same program, which significantly improves the performance. The process is divided into smaller subtasks, which  can then be processed by any of the processors. This is coordinated by the operating system. Parallel processing can be achieved through different methods - through using multiple processors in a computer or by distributing tasks across multiple cores in a CPU or GPU (such as SIMD processing).
