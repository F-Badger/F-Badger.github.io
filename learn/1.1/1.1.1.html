                        The <b>central processing unit</b> (<b>CPU</b>) has many components to allow it to perform its task of executing instruction, including:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>control unit (CU)</li>
                        <li>registers</li>

                        The <b>arithmetic logic unit</b> (<b>ALU</b>) performs arithmetic and logical operations on data. It can:
                    </p>
                    <ul>    
                        <li>perform mathematical operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide) on numbers</li>
                        <li>perform shift operations (moving bits right/left in a register)</li>
                        <li>carry out Boolean logic operations, comparing 2 values and using operators like AND, OR, NOT, XOR</li>

                        <li>controlling the fetch-decode-execute cycle</li>

                    </ul>

                        <b>Registers</b> are special memory cells which operate at high speed, and are where all arithmetic, logical and shift operations occur. There are several special-purpose registers:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>program counter</b> (<b>PC</b>) - holds the address of the next instruction to be executed</li>
                        <li><b>accumulator</b> (<b>ACC</b>) - stores the results of calculations (performed by ALU)</li>
                        <li><b>memory address register</b> (<b>MAR</b>) - holds the address of a location that is to be read from or written to</li>
                        <li><b>memory data register</b> (<b>MDR</b>) - temporarily stores data read from/written to memory</li>
                        <li><b>current instruction register</b> (<b>CIR</b>) - holds the current instruction being executed </li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <div class="list-container">
                    <p>
                        <b>Buses</b> are a set of parallel wires, connecting 2 or more components within the CPU to allow the transmission of data. The three important ones are:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>data bus</b> - transports data and instructions between components</li>
                        <li><b>address bus</b> - carries the address of the memory location being read from/written to to the memory</li>
                        <li><b>control bus</b> - transmits control signals between components, and ensures operations are synchronised.  The control bus coordinates the use of the address and data buses by different components and provides status information between system components</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        The data and control bus are bi-directional (signals can be carried in both directions), but the address bus is unidirectional (the CPU sends addresses to the memory, but never receives any).
                    </p>
                </div>

                <p>
                    <b>Assembly language</b> uses mnemonics to represent instructions, as a simplified way of representing machine code. Each instruction is divided into operand (data or memory address of data upon which the operation is to be performed) and opcode (the type of instruction that needs to be executed).

                    <p>
                        There are a number of factors that affect the performance of the CPU, including <b>clock speed</b>, <b>number of cores</b> and the <b>amount of cache memory:</b>
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The <b>clock speed</b> of a processor (measured in hertz, Hz) is the number of fetch-decode-execute (FDE) cycles which it can perform each second. This speed is determined by the system clock, which generates signals which alternate between 0 and 1 and synchronises CPU operations, as each CPU operation begins as the clock changes from 0 to 1</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The higher the clock speed, the more FDE cycles that can occur each second, so the better the performance of the CPU</li>
                        </ul>
                        <li>A <b>core</b> is an independent processor which can run its own FDE cycle.  A computer with multiple cores can complete multiple FDE cycles at a time</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The more cores, the more FDE cycles can be executed at once, so the better the performance of the CPU. Theoretically, a dual-core processor should have twice the power of a single-core processor, but this isn't always the case as the software may not be able to take full advantage of both processors</li>
                        </ul>
                        <li><b>Cache</b> is very fast memory located within the CPU and holds data and instructions copied from main memory in case they are needed again soon. This saves the time that would be taken fetching them again from main memory. As it fills up, unused instructions and data still being held are replaced. There are different levels of cache, with level 1 being the smallest and closest to the CPU. Subsequent levels are larger and further from the CPU
                        <ul>
                            <li>The more cache a computer has, the more data and instructions can be held in fast memory so performance is improved</li>
                        </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>

            </div>

            <div id="pipelining">

                <p>
                    <b>Pipelining</b> is a process which can be used to improve the performance of a processor. Normally, all the steps in the FDE cycle would take place one after another. leaving some parts of the CPU idle. Pipelining prevents this - while one instruction is being executed, another is being decoded and another is fetched from memory. Appropriate data is kept in a buffer in close proximity to the CPU until it is required. This doesn’t work for code that branches (instructions that cause the execution of a different instruction sequence).
